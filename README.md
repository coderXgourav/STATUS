**HTTP Status Codes for MERN Projects**

### Understanding HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are essential for effective communication between a client and a server. They provide feedback on the outcome of a request, enabling robust error handling and user experience improvement.

**Common HTTP Methods and Their Status Codes**

### GET (Retrieve Data)
